#Export Scoutbook

##Introduction

A Chrome extension to export reports from Scoutbook to an Excel file.

To use this, install it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/export-scoutbook/iibpknbhchmgbmldbloabhhopdoonlni?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog), or clone/download this repo and install it in Chrome locally using [Developer Mode](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked)

This is a side project that I work on in my free time, and pretty much on an as-needed basis (for my needs, of course...). Feel free to fork and push changes to the code here, and I'll get them updated.
